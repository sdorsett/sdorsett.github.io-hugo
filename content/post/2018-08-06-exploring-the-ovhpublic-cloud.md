This post is the beginning of a series of posts that will explain how to use the openstack-based OVH public cloud UI and opensource tools that you can use to automate and manage your openstack infrastructure. 

Over the last few years, I have worked primarily with VMware products and have not taken the time to learn with openstack. Now that the OVH public cloud has launched in the United States, and I work for OVH US, I figured it was time to start learning how customers could put this offering to use.

The posts in this series of blog that have been released are:
